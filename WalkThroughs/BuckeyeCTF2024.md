A couple tweaks and we got the flag

Given a .zip and a 7z

Running bkcrack we can see the encryption method was Zipcrypto

```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fc5945d-7630-4098-9b83-4102e926c345)

The challenge description mentions both files were protected with the same password so if we can crack the .zip we should be able to open the 7z

Create the plaintext and run bkcrack

What we really want tho is the password to open up the 7z

We can also use hashcat 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb15de4f-2b1c-4366-8a54-e6949040cd0b)


`7z x important_flags.7z`

It is password protected and partially encrypted. We can still get some information about the file and see its using 40-bit encryption.

Reading this series of blog posts gives us all we need to crack it. The key to the challenge is.... the key. 

`https://blog.didierstevens.com/2017/12/28/cracking-encrypted-pdfs-part-3/`

First step is to get the hash with john. Hashcat doesnt want the title at the front so we have to take that out.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f450f95-829a-419e-b22a-a243ea7c475a)

Should look like

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf1cb0d1-0bd2-4259-9af3-58e09cac9ad0)

The hint in the description tells us that the first byte in the key is `b8`. Using hashcat with this info it cracked in a couple minutes.
Without that first byte hint it was expected to take over aday.

![Pasted image 20240928171501](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/894f3c68-5025-45b4-919a-9b5ba36b19c3)

The key is `b895821f14`

Now with this key we can keep reading the blog post and Mr Stevens explains he forked and modded `qpdf` to be able to decrypt pdfs with the key instead of the password.

![Pasted image 20240928151700](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dad7dbe-88f2-4145-b200-7fb09133c5be)

OG qpdf was updated. Could have also used

```
qpdf --password=b895821f14 --password-is-hex-key --decrypt here.pdf unlocked.pdf 
```
Additionally, with the key and hash it is also possible to get the password.

Create the solve script

Command Detection:

    The first byte of the HID packet (data[0] == 0xA9) indicates a valid command.
    The second byte (cmd = data[1]) represents the specific command. The command ID is looked up in the cmds dictionary to determine what type of action it represents.
    If the command is AMC_SET_TRAVAL, the script begins processing keypresses by looking at the row_mask data.

HID Keypress Mapping:

    The HID data uses a matrix-based system, where the keyboard is represented as rows and columns in MAP_MATRIX. Each key on the keyboard is mapped to a specific row and column.
    The row_mask stores which keys have been pressed. The script iterates through each row and column using nested loops (for r in range(6) and for c in range(15)).
    For each key that has been pressed (row_mask[r] & (0x01 << c)), the corresponding key from MAP_MATRIX is retrieved and appended to final_message.
