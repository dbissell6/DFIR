# Explorations and Reflections: Part 4

Winter 2023

It feels like a lifetime since our last update(Spring 2023). Let's dive into what transpired and reflect upon it.

Initially, our prime objective was to delve deep into Blue Team/DFIR. At that time, platforms like Hack The Box Academy had not yet released their Blue Team content. 
My perception of the SANS courses was that they were overpriced, and I was unaware of alternative resources. 
To navigate through this limitation, I decided to adopt a hands-on approach. This journey saw me completing roughly 100 challenges on platforms like Pico and HTB. Thus, the Bluebook was conceived.

Fast forward from this spring, and we have witnessed:

    Technical job interviews centered around this DFIR content.
    The launch of HTB's Blue Team SOC path.
    My role as a TA for a DFIR course.
    Discovering resources like cyberdefenders.org.
    Gaining access to genuine DFIR textbooks through the local university library.
    

Each of these experiences reinforced the belief that my learning trajectory, built around CTFs, was a sound approach. 
While I did glean insights from each encounter, the foundational knowledge came from earlier experiences.

This has prompted me to contemplate: What exactly are we investing in when enrolling in platforms like HTB Academy? 
Essentially, the academy offers modules with text-based content on specific topics and practical exercises. 
These resources are freely available online. Thus, I believe we're paying for a well-curated structure. 
Platforms like Academy spotlight individual steps in the learning process, offering guidance at each stage.


## A Prophesy 

Enter ChatGPT. Integrating it into my learning and reflection process has offered a glimpse into the potential future of education. LLMs like GPT could revolutionize personalized learning. 
By assessing a learner's existing skill set and the current state of the field, a tailored curriculum can be generated dynamically, ensuring content remains up-to-date, especially crucial in ever-evolving
fields like cybersecurity.

For instance, a noob may not know what a .lnk file is. When reading about this the LLM could know this and include a description/definition of it when presenting related 
information. When this same related information is presented to a more expereinced learner it will not need to include the definition of what a .lnk file is.

Moreover, learners bring a wealth of knowledge from diverse domains. LLMs can harness this knowledge, crafting relatable metaphors that elucidate complex concepts. In the realm of medicine, 
'adaptive questionnaires' have gained prominence. In the realm of learning tools such as these could ensure learners are never overwhelmed or bored.

Historically, before the era of large classes and standardized tests, assessments were conversational between the educator and the student. LLMs might herald a return to this intimate, personalized approach.

Reiterating the initial question: What are we essentially paying for? The answer is structured learning. 
LLMs hold the potential to offer this much-needed structure, drawing from the vast amount of data available online.

Even visual content platforms, like YouTube, aren't immune to this change. Customized, generative video content might soon become a reality, enhancing the user's learning experience.

We arn't there yet, but I imagine it is on the horizon. For now I will continue to study the current way.

## New Challenge Same Graph

I recently stumbled upon Cyberdefenders.org, it seems like a promising platform offering an array of CTF challenges. 
My aim is to tackle as many of these as possible before the upcoming winter SANS Holiday Kringlecon and HTB's CTF.

I flipped back to wanting to continue to grow the graph. With my growing understanding of the threatscape, the value of the overview of the different domains has diminished. But now because I know the domains 
I can more easily find related material and jog my memory of the previous challenges.
I include the tabluar data to view the same info in a different format. I'm currently fine-tuning the algorithm to link nodes and
forsee a time when the graph will be too convoluted and a pruning of nodes will be needed. When there are challenges that are the same the writeups are the same and the knowldge becomes 
redundant and burdensome. In the realm there needs to be a better way to differtiate the challenges within groups. Seeing 50 pcap challs isnt helpful. Being able to detail how challenges 
within the same category are different is becoming much more important.

## Final

As I was wrapping this reflection up HackTheBoo2023 dropped. It was a more noob friendly format with the first 2 days being 3 very easy challenges and the last 2 days containing an easy and medium challenge
for each category. All of the DFIR challenges felt very easy. It feels good, it looks like the training is paying off. Im going to have to start tackling a new category soon.
