Last time we met I had just discovered cyberdefenders and completed HackTheBoo. Since then HTB released 'Sherlocks', DFIR challenges, the inital batch and the 
holiday challs. SANS kringlecon released.

Full reflection on cyberdefenders. 

Compare to whative seen in sherlocks.

Since this time last year(compare to what i wrote about this time last year)

Short commings? Successess? Desires? Predictions?
