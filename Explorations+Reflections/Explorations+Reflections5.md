Winter 2023 (December 27thish) 


Each time I write one of these it feels craxy how fast time passes. This entry then has double significance, it marks a new quarter and the completon of the first year.


Last time we met I had just discovered cyberdefenders and completed HackTheBoo. Since then HTB released 'Sherlocks', DFIR challenges, the inital batch and the 
holiday challs. SANS kringlecon released.

## Full reflection on cyberdefenders. 

Cyberdefenders is a site to learn DFIR. Contains a large set of diverse challenges. One of this types of chalenges it excels in compared to HTB is giving
the player a SIEM. Other than that the site contains content in the form you would expect. I dont like how it forces the player to use a web broswer on each challenge. I spend so much time and money getting my environment ready for analysis, dont force me to use a lagging environment with no tools.

## Compare to what I've seen in sherlocks.



## Sherlocks vs cyberdefender

Its really not a contest. VIP for HTB ~= 14 per month. Sub to cyberdefender ~=20 per month. Even if you concluded the blue team content is the same on both sites,
HTB VIP will also give you access to red team content for 40% of the price.



## Fell down malware analysis rabbit hole dynamic analysis, anti-anti-debugging

There was a series of sherlocks that contained some ransomware that needed to be understood. Im not sure exactly what happened but something in me changed during this. 


## Since this time last year(compare to what i wrote about this time last year)

This whole DFIR journey started a year ago. I was competing in CTFs still struggling with easy questions and decided i need to focus on one of the 5 categories
(web,pwn,reversing,cryptography,forensics). Early on was a struggle. I was able to open up pcaps and logs with wireshark or event viewer but quickly realized it wasnt practical to manually read through these. I developed simple python tools to parse the data. a couple months after i found out about tools like chainsaw and zeek. While I dont use the python tools as much i do feel it was proably valuable to go that route and make them. 

Another thing i listed as struggling with in the first year was understanding windows languages. In that complaint I can see the see of my love of dynamic analysis, who cares what it says, what does it do?

The final problem I wrote in that inital stretch was getting volatility to work. Since then I have noticed a steady improvment in the tool with each version that has been released. 


## Short commings? Successess? Desires? Goals? Predictions?
