Winter 2023 (December 27thish) 


Each time I write one of these it feels craxy how fast time passes. This entry then has double significance, it marks a new quarter and the completon of the first year.


Last time we met I had just discovered cyberdefenders and completed HackTheBoo. Since then HTB released 'Sherlocks', DFIR challenges, the inital batch and the 
holiday challs. SANS kringlecon released.

## Full reflection on cyberdefenders. 

Cyberdefenders is a site to learn DFIR. Contains a large set of diverse challenges. One of this types of chalenges it excels in compared to HTB is giving
the player a SIEM. Other than that the site contains content in the form you would expect. I dont like how it forces the player to use a web broswer on each challenge. I spend so much time and money getting my environment ready for analysis, dont force me to use a lagging environment with no tools.

## Compare to what I've seen in sherlocks.



## Sherlocks vs cyberdefender

Its really not a contest. VIP for HTB ~= 14 per month. Sub to cyberdefender ~=20 per month. Even if you concluded the blue team content is the same on both sites,
HTB VIP will also give you access to red team content for 40% of the price.

Short commings? Successess? Desires? Predictions?
